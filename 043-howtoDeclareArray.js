// This lesson covers how to Declare Array 

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
//console.log(arr[3]) // it will count from 0 and this output will be 4
arr [10] = 11
console.log(arr.length)
// console.log(arr)    // try this line for seeing how much it is printing 
// it will define some empty arrays because we havent defined them

// To replace any array then 
arr [3]=35
console.log(arr)

// to declare array with constractor
let arr2 = Array[1,3,4]
console.log(arr2)    // previous one is easy and mostly used
